<td valign="top"> Use the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST database</a> of handwritten digits from 0 through 9 and test the performance of different classifiers on how well they can learn to identify individual digits. The dataset has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

The images from the training dataset would be the input for the classifier and the know identity of the digit would be used to train the classfier. The performance of the classifier is then tested on the test set of images which have never been shown to the classifier. Compare the error rate (the fraction of test dataset images which were not correctly classified) for SVM classifier with different kernel functions (linear, polynomial).

<td valign="top"> Use the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST database</a> of handwritten digits from 0 through 9 and explore the existence and number of distinct clusters in that dataset. Use the k-means clustering algorithm with different number of pre-determined clusters to find. Evalute the separation between the found clusters using the Silhouette analysis. Use both together, the training set 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

The images from the training dataset would be the input for the clustering algorithm. The know identity of the digit can be used to verify whether clusters found corespond to a specific digit. Which digits fall into indistinguishable clusters?

<td valign="top">Extract spike times from an electrophysiological recordings and characterize spiking statistics. You are provided with whole-cell recordings from medium spiny neurons in the striatum which received pre-synaptic inputs and current injections. The direct current injection elicited action potenials in the recorded neurons. The aim is to extract the times of the presynaptic stimulation - from the stimulus artifact - and the times of the postsynaptic action potentials. Firing rates, the coefficient of variation and the time difference between the pre-synaptic stimulation and the postsynaptic action potentials are to be calculated.

The aim of the project is to establish the preferred head direction of presubicular neurons. For that puropse, the spike-times need to be combined with the known orientation of animals throughout the experiment. Additional, spiking statistics such as firing rate and coefficient of variation are to be calculated.

The visual stimulation consisted of random dot kinematograms which moved in a different direction for each 500 ms stimulus presentation. The recorded neurons in area MT are directional tuned. The task would be to calculate the peri-stimulus time histogram for each stimulus and determine the directional tuning curve of each recorded neuron.

You will study which paw and which event - the onset of the swing or the onset of the stance phase - modulate the firing rate.  You can study this by computing the peristimulus time histograms for the four paws and the two events.

<td valign="top">In this project, you will implement a numerical simulation of the Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model with refractory period, i.e., for which after each spike the membrane potential is frozen for a short period of time during which inputs are not integrated. This refractory period represents roughly the duration of the action potential in real neurons. You will use the Euler method to solve numerically the subthreshold voltage dynamics in the presence of random, fluctuating inputs, and combine this with a threshold detection mechanism to identify spike times and implement the reset. For a fixed choice of input resistance, threshold and reset potential, you will plot the firing rate as a function of the remaining parameters: (i) the mean and (ii) the standard deviation of the input current, and (iii) the duration of the refractory period.

<td valign="top"> <b>Exponential-Integrate-and-Fire model</b></td>
<td valign="top">The Exponential-Integrate-and-Fire (EIF) neuron model is a slight modification of the classical Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model. Compared to the LIF, the EIF contains an additional, active current that grows exponentially with the potential, characterized by two parameters: a threshold value and the sharpness of the spike onset. This current represents the action-potential-initiating sodium current without explicitly modelling the ion channel dynamics (i.e., no additional variable is introduced). In the EIF, a spike occurs when the potential diverges, which in practice is implemented by comparing the voltage to a large finite value. You will use the Euler method to solve numerically the voltage dynamics in the presence of random, fluctuating inputs, and combine this with a threshold detection mechanism to identify spike times and implement the reset. For a fixed choice of input resistance, threshold parameter and reset potential, you will plot the firing rate as a function of the remaining parameters: (i) the mean and (ii) the standard deviation of the input current, and (iii) the sharpness of the spike onset.

<td valign="top"> <b>Decoding working memory contents from EEG</b></td>
<td valign="top">Human subjects perform an oculomotor delayed response task, in which they see a stimulus on a screen and have to remember its angular location over a brief delay period. During this task, scalp EEG signals are recorded. The project aims at learning to read out  working memory contents from alpha frequency power (8-12 Hz) in EEG, which is known to decrease on electrodes contralaterally to the location of attended or remembered stimuli. To achieve this, you will implement a neural decoder that uses the distribution of signals across different electrodes. There are many methods that can be used for neural decoding, e.g. linear regression or classifiers (such as SVM) which can be coded by hand or called via scikits-learn. An important concept that you will apply during this project is cross-validation, i.e. training your model on one part of the data, and keeping separate "unseen" data apart to validate the model. The dataset consists of an example subject with ~ 1000 trials where different locations were remembered. TIme-resolved alpha power is already extracted from the EEG signals.

<td valign="top">Implement a network of recurrently connected leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons using the Brian simulator. The network should match "Model B" from Brunel, J Comp Neurosci (2000), e.g. in its parametrization used in Fig. 2A. Verify that your networks exhibits the expected dynamics in the different regimes (SR, AI, SI fast osc., SI slow osc.) and plot the activity for representative parametrizations of each regime (e.g. like in Fig. 8). For further information, consider reading the description of the "Brunel network" in chapter 13.4 of the "Neuronal Dynamics" textbook by Gerstner et al. (available online: https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/) – note that you can ignore the analytical investigation (Fokker-Planck equations, etc.), both in that chapter and in the original paper.

<td valign="top"> <b>Coupled oscillators</b></td>
<td valign="top">Implement a simple "network" of two leaky-integrate-and-fire neuron. Each of the neurons should receive a constant input current that makes it spike regularly. Connect the two neurons via a simple synapse (i.e. the first neuron connects to the second, and the second neuron connects to the first). If you start the two neurons with different initial values of their membrane potentials, what behaviour do you see if the two neurons are 1) unconnected, 2) connected with excitatory synapses 3) connected with inhibitory synapses? Neurons of this type are often analysed as "oscillators" that are described by a frequency and a phase. See how this can help you describe the behaviour of the two neurons in the 3 situations considered above.

<td valign="top">Create a LIF neuron, following the model from homework 8 but without the external current I_ext. Connect two, independent Poisson spike train generators (i.e. PoissonGroup) to this neuron, each firing with 1000Hz. One of them should be excitatory and increase the synaptic current I_syn by w_exc, the other should be inhibitory and decrease the synaptic current by w_inh. Run two sets of simulations. In each set, you vary w_exc between 10mV and 25mV, but in the first set w_inh=w_exc-2*mV, whereas in the second set w_inh=w_exc-8*mV. For each simulation, analyze the mean and standard deviation of the synaptic current I_syn, as well as the neuron's firing rate and the CV of its ISI distribution. What do you observe? Note that to get sufficient spikes for the statistic, you should run simulations for at least 10s.
